## My process

  I did a mobile first workflow making all the boxes of the same size then wrote a media query for larger acreen sizes and applied css grid for the layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- media queries

### What I learned

I used this project to challenge my knowledge of css grid and responsive design. I learnt the power of css grid to quickly createa structured layout writing as little css code as possible. I also learnt how to optimize a website for different screen sizes (it's a bit of stress).

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating structured responsive layouts as well as writing more optimized rather than redundant code.

### Useful resources

- [css grid youtube video](https://youtu.be/_lEkD8IGkwo?si=1OGvdsvVJ6F7Ic6t) - This helped me to understand css grid and hoe to use it in this situation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
